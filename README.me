# Benchmark of SpMV with OpenMP

This repository contains an analisys of the Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) algorithm. 
The implementation is in C and parallelized with OpenMP. 

The main goal is to mesure the impact of different strategies of scheduling (offered by OpenMP) 
on the efficency of the parallelization, with different number of threads and types of matrix.

### Matrices used for the test

The benchmark is executed on a set of sparse matrices, automatically downloaded from the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection (sparse.tamu.edu):

- twotone (ATandT) 
- Transport (Janna)
- cage14 (vanHeukelum)
- torso1 (Norris)
- memchip (Freescale)
